CV Generator project from the Odin Project

Initially created components as class components per instructions on the project.
I came back and converted most components to functional components and utilized useState hook.
I also added the ability to print or save the resume as a PDF. 

I wanted to experiment using styled components rather than CSS stylesheets.  
I also wanted to import an icon from Font Awesome to create a cleaner look for adding pieces to the resume.
